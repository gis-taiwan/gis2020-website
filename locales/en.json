        "2": "Over the past few decades, the world has been evolving at an increasingly rapid pace. Nowadays, new trends and technologies spring up nearly every day, often distracting us from the real issues that lie below the surface. Many people in our world today believe that we can make constructive and powerful influences on the world by merely writing sarcastic tweets, making comments online, or putting the blame on politicians and scientists. However, we at GIS Taiwan think differently.",
        "3": "We believe that one can’t truly make significant changes to our world without finding the origins of the problems we perceive on the surface. Everyone in this global community has a duty to actively dig deeper into the issues we care about by ourselves. Depending on new technologies, blindly following every trend, and believing everything the media tells us will never contribute to a long-lasting solution that will actually benefit our community. It is time we leave our screens and take responsibility. Find the roots of current problems and take real action to improve the situation. Hence, reset the mindset.",
        "4": "As a result, this year, we want to transform the traditional thinking model, reset the thinking perspective, reexamine what we are familiar with ourselves, and further explore problems on the old thinking model. By doing so, we can look at the complete picture of the problems and redefine the roots of them.",
        "5": "GIS Taiwan 2020 will bring together elites from all fields, including industries, government and academia, to provide a platform for young people to communicate freely. In this way, student delegates can have a more inclusive attitude and deeper understanding on the problems and explore the nature of those issues. Then, the student delegates will be able to break through the existing rigid thinking system through interactions and discussions and create infinite possibilities.",
        "6": "After thorough discussions with scholars and experts, GIS organizing team successfully collected a large amount of data on the current international trends to define the academic topics for this year. After careful analysis, the annual theme structure is split into three levels.",

Academic topics of second level will be focus on humanities and social issues. They will be discussed in Keynote Speech, Panel Discussion, and Workshop. Speakers and delegates will generate deep viewpoints on concerning issues through further interactions and discussions. The third level will aim at business side of the four major topics. By participating in Action Project, delegates can develop practical ideas and applications with the assistance of mentors.",

In addition, the close linkage between environmental degradation and economic development has not only drawn the attention of the public, but the industries and the government. Besides of the public, some corporates are putting efforts to their Corporate Social Responsibility to fit their government policy. Nevertheless, striving to solve the environmental problem fundamentally, we must implement the solutions starting from our daily lives, which is currently undergoing with an unprecedented transformation.Through the Action Project Green Hunting, student delegates will investigate and propose a solution to make go green not only a slogan, but a direct action.",
