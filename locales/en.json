The Chinese name “集思” is taken from the homonym of the abbreviation GIS. We hope that young people from all over the world can gather at GIS Taiwan to \"brainstorm ideas (集思)\" about global trends. GIS Taiwan not only inspires our prospects of the future, but also encourages pupils to influence the world in their own ways.",
        "3": "GIS Taiwan holds the largest student forum annually. Through assembling scholars from different fields, leaders from business enterprises and student delegates from every corner of the world, GIS Taiwan integrates the application of academy and practice. It's meant to provide an interdisciplinary and cross-generation platform for the goal to produce a practical impact project.",

Even under the fear of strikes of shocks at any time and the confrontation of new trends, we are still to organize our thinking and find the “normal” at the moment. After the development of sufficient understanding, a suitable approach to deal with it naturally derives from it, so that the changes can be faced without haste.",
