        "3": "However, as time evolves with the accumulation of experience from generations, we have entered a rapidly changing generation. Thanks to the vigorous development of technology and civilization, a considerable amount of information accumulates, in addition to the iterative updates of, literally, everything. The world is rapidly advancing, with new materials generated at the scale of seconds.",
        "4": "As we are today, various challenges arise daily; trying to keep up with the zeitgeist and grasping the newest trend have never been so demanding. However, with the world changing at this fast pace, does “normality” still exist? Or, should there be no normal, yet such also gives birth to a new one at the same time? Under the impetus of times, people move forward, try to find new positions and definitions, yet still ways of coping with the new life patterns in the dynamic world.",
        "5": "This year, we put our focus on “normal”. Even under the fear of strikes of shocks at any time and the confrontation of new trends, we are still to organize our thinking and find the “normal” at the moment. After the development of sufficient understanding, a suitable approach to deal with it naturally derives from it, so that the changes can be faced without haste.",
